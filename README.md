# Hello-World

I am Richard from Ghana hoping to develop my programing skills from a beginer to the altimate level.

I always had the notion learning to programe/code was very difficult until I watched "How to teach yourself code (ft. Quincy Larson)" on youtube.
I has given me the courage and zeal to learn to code and I believe I would succeed.


Thanks
